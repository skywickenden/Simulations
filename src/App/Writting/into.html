We are becoming ever better at making society more efficient, yet inequality is increasing. We have already automated away a plethora of jobs and yet we still all have to work as hard as ever to get by. Housing is considerably more expensive than it has been for generations even after taking inflation into account. Something is wrong with modern society. It could be so much better. On this website I am going to introduce a new idea. This is not a rehashing of an old idea such as communisim. A new way for us to organise society.  It is hard to explain in a few words how this new way works and why it would make your life better, but nether the less here goes:

Internet technology makes it possible to combine the freemarket and democracy into a new medium of exchange that makes both function more effectively.

Imagine you are a tribal person who has never encountered the modern world before. An intrepid adventurer appears one day. They really like a bowl that you have carved and manage to communicate that they would like to have it. In return they will give you a piece of paper with someone's face on it. In other words they want to buy it. You have never encountered money before. If someone from another tribe has wanted something of yours before you would either give it as a gift to cement your relationship or expect something of equal value in return. The piece of paper looks pretty, so you decide to take it anyway, but you have no idea that you have just sold your bowl. The new method of organising society that I want to share with you faces a similar problem. The shallow introduction above does not give any indication of how it works, it just presents a shiny bauble. Here is an introduction that whilst correct is way too dense for those not familiar with the subject matter.

[This bit mostly hidden in an enfolded section]
Society is an emergently complex thermodynamic system. It is organised through the interactions of its main component parts – us humans. When we interact with each other we exchange embodied entropy in ways that enable society as a whole to absorb energy with a low level of entropy from our environment and excrete energy with high entropy. We do this through two forms of feedback loop. Positive loops, that enables society to adapt to new challenges and negative ones that stabilise society and protect it from decay. The main short term adaptive feedback loop arises from our exchange of embodied entropy - food, tools, shelter etc. In the modern day this is mainly facilitated by the freemarket. The main stabilising feedback loop is formed out of our commination with each other and the social institutions that are built from that. In the modern day this is mainly achieved through democracy. There is also a long term adaptive feedback loop in our ability to invent new technologies – these enable the ways in which we interact to evolve and thus change the very fabric and structure of society. Both the freemarket and democracy are based on inventions that are at best centuries old and at heart millennia. The invention of computers and the internet presents a new possibility for society. One, which due to the nature of emergent complexity is going to be adapted whether we like it or not. This possibility is essentially the ability for the singular metrics that are used to measure the free market (money) and democracy (votes) to be combined into a matrix of values that can in turn be computed with algorithms that makes for a far more efficient market process and a far less corruptible and inefficient democracy.  The stability and adaptive capabilities of the system are achieved through the feedback loops that are embodied in the algorithms. Just to be clear, I am not talking about something as blasé as electronic voting or bitcoins. I am talking about a completely novel form of society that does not use money and yet has a hyper adaptive marketplace. A society in which no one is elected and yet results in an extremely responsive and equalitative democracy that is resistant to corruption.

Blah, blah blah… If you understood all that then well done, you’re a cleverer person than I am. It’s taken a decade of study to write it as succinctly as that. In another decade I might be able to make it a few lines shorter.

Neither of these explanations really communicate what I am trying to say. For that I am going to need to go one step at a time. In this age of instant gratification click bait posts I am asking you to be patient and bare with me through some long form writing. But don’t worry there are going to be many fun and games along the way. I love to make interactive demonstrations and games so there are going to be plenty of buttons to click and opportunities to use god like powers that decide the fate of civilizations of game characters. For a little taster, here ….
